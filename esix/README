How to use esix ?

1. First, you have to customize the config.h file to make esix work on your hardware.
2. Then, you need to implement some wrappers (memory allocation, timer, ethernet frame management). These wrappers are OS dependant. See include/esix.h to know exactly what you have to implement.


include/
	contains the main headers for users
lib/
