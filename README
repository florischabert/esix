| Esix, a light-weight IPv6 stack |
+---------------------------------+

Stack
-----

- TCPv6
- UDP
- ICMPv6, ND, MLD
- IPv6
- Ethernet

- POSIX socket interface.

Integration
-----------

Integrating esix with your software stack is the easiest thing:

1. Customize the stack at compile time using config.h
2. Create a send handler so esix can easily send data to your network interface.
3. Call esix_eth_process from your incoming frame handler so esix can deal with it.
2. Setup esix by calling esix_init. See include/esix.h for details.
4. Enjoy.

Sample Code
-----------

- Esix works well with libcap. The glued daemon emulates a network interface that uses the esix stack and allows you to play with it on Dsktop. More in pcap/.

- A FreeRTOS integration for the ARM-based TI LM3S6965 eval board is provided. See freertos/.
